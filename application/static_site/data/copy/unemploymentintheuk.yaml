      - between 2014 and 2015, we estimate that 5% of the UK’s total potential workforce were unemployed
      - black people were 3 times more likely to be unemployed than White people
      - overall, more men than women were unemployed
      - young people aged 16 to 24 had the highest unemployment rate
      - the group with the lowest rate of unemployment were White people over 50
      - since 2002, the rate of unemployment in the UK has fallen for all ethnic groups

              - This data shows the rate of UK unemployment as a percentage of the total number of people who could potentially be working.
              - We define the unemployed as people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the past 4 weeks. They also need to be available to start work in the next 2 weeks. The unemployed figure also includes people who are out of work, but have found a job and will start it in the next 2 weeks.
              - The level and rate of UK unemployment are measured by the <a href='https://www.ons.gov.uk/surveys/informationforhouseholdsandindividuals/householdandindividualsurveys/labourforcesurveylfs'>Labour Force Survey</a> (LFS), using a definition of unemployment from the <a href='http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm'>International Labour Organisation</a>.

            - These unemployment figures are estimates based on a national survey and therefore are subject to sampling error and in some cases may not reflect the actual population.
            - Smaller numbers of survey respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that unemployment estimates for ethnic minorities are more unreliable than estimates for White people.
            - Results derived from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data especially for sub groups (for example, a particular ethnic group, age group and gender). Any values based on fewer than five responses have been completely suppressed. Values based on 5-10 responses are shown, but marked by an asterisk (*). These should be used with particular caution.
            - Estimates for unemployment rates by ethnicity by age by gender are given as annual estimates rather than quarterly estimates as sample sizes are not large enough to give reliable quarterly estimates.
            - Changes were made to the Labour Force Survey ethnicity questions in January to March 2011 to bring them more in line with Census data collection on these topics. In April to June 2011 furthers changes were made to the ethnicity questions to bring them in line with Scottish Census. As a result there may be some inconsistencies with estimates prior to 2011.
