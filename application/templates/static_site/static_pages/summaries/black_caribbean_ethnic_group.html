    <p class="govuk-body">This is a summary of statistics about Black Caribbean people in England and Wales.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">It is the first in a planned series of summaries about different ethnic groups.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This page includes:</p>

      <li>some population statistics from the most recent Census (2011)</li>
      <li>data on outcomes for Black Caribbean people compared with White British people, in areas including education,
        crime and policing, housing and mental health</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">The White British ethnic group is used for comparison as it is the largest group, making up
      80.5% of the
      population of England and Wales in 2011.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This is an overview based on a selection of data published on <a href="/"
         class="govuk-link">Ethnicity facts and figures</a> or being published soon. Some data (for example, on
      employment and income) is only available for the broad Black ethnic group, and is therefore not included here.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Each section includes details of the time period covered by the data. Population and crime
      data covers England
      and Wales. Data on education, mental health and housing covers England only.</p>
