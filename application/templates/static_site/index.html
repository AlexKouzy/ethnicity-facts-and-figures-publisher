                <p>
                    Government departments collect data and run surveys, which include information on ethnicity. This is
                    the first time that this data has been shown together in one place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will be able to see how experiences and outcomes differ for people of various ethnicities across
                    public sector services, which cover important areas of their life such as health, work and
                    education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now government departments and other organisations can see where there are differences and where
                    there is a need for change in order to have a fairer Britain.
